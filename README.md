FreeDPath - The Free Diagnostic Pathology Software Project

This project is hosted on the FreeDP website (see above). The principle and aims are sound and laudable, however this project has a major drawback in that it has a dependency on the proprietary and closed source FileMaker application. This application is available on a 30-day free trial from http://info.filemaker.com/GL_en_GB_FileMaker_Trial_LP.html?source=ppc&keyword=filemaker%20trial&utm_campaign={campid}&gclid=CKHP55e1_LwCFafnwgodY24A-g

The "source" for this project is unfortunately a big blob of FileMaker Pro file. The intellectual property contained therein is released under an OSI approveed Open Source License. We have 'forked' this IP here, in the hope that there may be interest in refactoring the project to use a genuinely open source platform.
